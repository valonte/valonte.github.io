DISCALIMER: The webpage created does NOT have a Responsive Design

The 3 Items I would like be graded for Part 3 are:
	1. 5 or more unique images (1 background image in the main page and 4 on the contact page)
	2. Navigation Bar
	3. 2 External Links (Social Media Links for Facebook and Instagram. LinkedIn link is not added yet since I have to fix my linkein account first)

These are three website used as my inspiration

    <p class = "edupara">For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to attend the University of the Philippines. 
	With this desire, deciding where to attend college was simple. 
	The University’s Geodetic Engineering departments is the only accredited Center of Excellence 
	for Geodetic Engineering by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). My Bachelor's Program focused on the field of land
	surveying and mapping. The programs also exposed us to the fields of geodesy, remote sensing, photogrammetry, and geographic 
	information systems (GIS). Studying at this prestigious and historic institution has had a profound impact on me in a variety of ways. 
	If there is one thing I will never forget, it is the phrase "Honor before Excellence." </p>

	<h4 class = "coursehead">High School Diploma (2014)</h4>
    <p class = "edupara">My elementary and high school years were spent in De La Salle University - Integrated 
	School which is located in Laguna, Philippines. I was one of the first few students to enroll when the 
	school first opened its doors. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with my friends, classmates and teachers, 
	and I met the love of my life while attending this school. To cap it off, I also graduated sixth in my batch. 
	As a result of this school’s science-oriented curriculum, I developed a strong interest in the sciences which drove 
	me to pursue a degree in Geodetic Engineering.</p>
