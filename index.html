LANDING PAGE OF MY WEBSITE
Created by: Vince Ruel Alonte
For: GEOM 101
DISCALIMER: The webpage created does NOT have a Responsive Design

The 3 Items I would like be graded for Part 3 are:
	1. 5 or more unique images (1 background image in the main page and 4 on the contact page)
	2. Navigation Bar
	3. 2 External Links (Social Media Links for Facebook and Instagram. LinkedIn link is not added yet since I have to fix my linkein account first)

These are three website used as my inspiration
http://www.garysheng.com/
https://www.quinntonharris.com/
https://melaniedaveid.com/

The Colors of the entire website is based on the
the color of my main photo. I used the link below
to pick the colors that I will be using

I will be creating a website with 4 different pages to simplify the look of my website
The first page will be the title page
The second page is my work background
The Third page is my educational background
Last, the final page will be a contact page

The website will be navigated using a navigation bar.
