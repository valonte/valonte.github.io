	<p class = "workpara">Shortly after passing the Philippine Geodetic Engineering Board Examination, I applied for a position 
	with the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA). NAMRIA is the central mapping agency of the Philippines which 
	survey, map and provide information regarding the country's land and water resources. As an Engineer I in the Photogrammetry 
	Division of the Mapping and Geodesy Branch at NAMRIA, I was part of the Topographic Map Database Project.
	In May 2021, I was part of a team in the field validation and completion of topographic maps for the City of Sorsogon, Philippines.  
	We travelled around Sorsogon City with four additional colleagues, verifying various points of interest. </p>
